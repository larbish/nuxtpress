# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:1) One
  2) Two
  3) Three
- More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_, and even _italics and later_ _bold_. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
const foo = 'bar'

function baz(s) {
  return `${foo}:${s}`
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears
